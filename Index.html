                    <h3>Project 1: 2D Array Project</h3>
                    <p>This Java application generates a random 2D array based on user-specified rows and columns. It computes and outputs various statistics such as sum, average, minimum, and maximum values of the entire array. Additionally, it calculates the average, sum of each row, and sum of a specific column. The program provides functionality to determine the frequency of a specified value within the generated 2D array.</p>
